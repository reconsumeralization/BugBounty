    "reasoning": "The feasibility hinges on successfully exploiting each vulnerability in sequence. The complexity arises from the potential need for specific timing, data manipulation, and bypassing individual security measures at each stage. High impact is possible if the chain leads to critical system compromise or data exfiltration. Detection is moderate; individual steps might be flagged, but the complete chain execution could appear as legitimate activity if carefully orchestrated. Known bypasses for intermediate steps significantly increase feasibility.",
